  summary: |
    I develop practical solutions from complex data and models, automating routine tasks with dashboards and predictive tools. With experience in both physics and data science, I specialize in deploying ML models and bridging the gap between technical teams and subject matter experts. 
    I value collaboration and impactful knowledge sharing to ensure solutions are both robust and aligned with business needs.
