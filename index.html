Hello and welcome!  
I work at the crossroads of physical modeling (optics and semiconductors), software development, automation, and applied data science. Whether it’s simulation, process automation, or innovative R&D, I strive for robust, interpretable, and impactful results.

Feel free to explore my projects, patents, and scientific contributions, and don’t hesitate to get in touch!
